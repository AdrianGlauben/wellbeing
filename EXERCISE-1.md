# Exercise 1 — Data Exploration

:house_with_garden: [Home](./README.md)

:open_book: [`dplyr` documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)

## Preparation

1. Install the `tidyverse` package by running `install.packages("tidyverse")`
   Tidyverse is a group of very popular packages (e.g., `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2` or `stringr`). This installation needs to run only once.
1. Load `tidyverse` by typing `library(tidyverse)` and hitting `Enter ⏎`. You need to run this every time you open RStudio again.

## Group task

1. Who is the shortest character?

```R
starwars %>%
   arrange(height)
```

2. Who is the tallest character?

```R
starwars %>%
   arrange(desc(height))
```

3. Find all droids.

```R
starwars %>%
   filter(species == 'Droid')
```

4. How many droids are there?

```R
starwars %>%
   filter(species == 'Droid') %>%
   summarise(n())
```

5. What is the home world of Han Solo?

```R
starwars %>%
   select(name, homeworld) %>%
   filter(name == 'Han Solo')
```

6. How many characters are there per species? Sort by ascending count.

```R
starwars %>%
    group_by(species) %>%
    summarise(count = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(count))
```

7. Change the height from `cm` to `m`.

```R
starwars %>%
   mutate(height = height / 100)
```

8. Filter out all characters that have missing values (`NA`) for their mass. How many are left?

```R
starwars %>%
   select(name, mass) %>%
   na.omit()
```

## Task 1

1. Find all characters with yellow eyes.
1. Remove all Gungans. How many characters are left?
1. What is the average mass of all droids?
1. Calculate the BMI for all humans (`mass / ((height / 100) ^ 2)`)
1. Which character has the longest name?
1. What is the earliest birth year for each species? (`birth_year` is measured in BBY = Before Battle of Yavin, so high values = earlier)
